## Requirements
- Node.js
- npm
- React Native

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install the dependencies.
- Run npx react-native start to start the development server.
- Open a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory, and run npx react-native run-android to launch the app on an Android emulator or device. Alternatively, run npx react-native run-ios to launch the app on an iOS emulator or device.

##Usage
Upon launching the app, you will see a simple interface with two tabs: "To-Do" and "Done".
